* Introduction
  Lued is a debugger. The eventual goal is to embed lua and do some
  fanciness with it.

  We're not quite there yet.

* Mac OS X
  For now support for Mac OS X is to be left on the side. It seems
  that some things are different on the Apple side of things. For
  instance *ptrace* on apple is much different.

  In the future this will hopefully be supported, but for now it's a
  bit of a headache to deal with multiple platforms.
